    `Hey, I‚Äôve been thinking about us lately, and honestly, I‚Äôm just really happy we met.
You seriously changed so much for me  brought light into my world when I didn‚Äôt even realize how much I needed it.`,
    `Thank you. That word feels small compared to what you‚Äôve done.
Remember those tough times? You were always there.
Not just standing by, but actually taking care of things  taking care of me.
Your patience, your strength... I leaned on that completely, and I‚Äôll never forget it.`,
    `You‚Äôre such a kind, strong, and genuine person.
I really wish you the best life ahead  good health, success, and endless peace and happiness.`,
    `Since it‚Äôs your special day, I wanted to share this beautiful poem by Emily Dickinson.
It reminds me of your spirit and how you always carry hope no matter what:
‚ÄúHope is the thing with feathers‚Äù - By Emily Dickinson`,
    `Hope is the thing with feathers
    That perches in the soul
    And sings the tune without the words
    And never stops at all
    And sweetest in the Gale is heard
    And sore must be the storm
    That could abash the little Bird
    That kept so many warm
    I‚Äôve heard it in the chillest land
    And on the strangest Sea
    Yet, never, in Extremity,
    It asked a crumb‚Äîof me.`,
    `Happy Birthday :)
Hope this year brings you all the love, joy, and everything good you deserve.
You truly deserve the best.`
